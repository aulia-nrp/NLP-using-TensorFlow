# bangkit-capstone-project-ml
This project was developed in Bangkit 2021 as the capstone projects. Very grateful I have an amazing team to build an android application that helps women to reports harrasment directly to Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection Indonesia. Me and my friend Joseph implemented NLP to classify text for 2 classification tasks in our app. First is report classification which classify the report that user made to some categories from the ministry, then second is post/story classification that classify the stories user made to share with each other. We collected the data by scraping Tweets on Twitter based on #MeToo movement. We used CNN for the model and got 80% accuracy for report classification and 78% accuracy for post classification.
